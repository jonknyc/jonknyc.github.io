# Building a Modern Blog with Next.js and MDX

Creating a modern blog requires the right mix of technologies. In this post, I'll share my experience building
this blog using Next.js, MDX, and Tailwind CSS.

## Why These Technologies?

Next.js provides an excellent foundation for building static and dynamic websites. Combined with MDX, we get
the power of Markdown with the flexibility of React components.

## Key Features

- Fast page loads with static generation
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Component reuse across blog posts
